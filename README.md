# severity_review
the data and code for the paper 'Using secondary cases to characterize the severity of an emerging or re-emerging infection'

program_rcpp.zip is the code for simulation without age component, program_rcpp_age.zip is the code for simulation with age difference in the interested outcome.

for each code, we can use the create_write.r file to generate the folder for simulation with different assumptions on incubation and infectiousness period.
